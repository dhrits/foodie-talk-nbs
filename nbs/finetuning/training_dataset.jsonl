Two of us went with the buffet and others went ala carte. The buffet appetizers served at the table were good and served hot. Veg appetizers were good, chicken was very average and the fish was quite good. Budget however looked tired and like food had been sitting for a while.

Classy ambience given it is Hyatt but I would rate the food a notch lower than it's pricier cousin in Banjara Hills. Food - Mushroom soup and veg sushi were quite well made. Tried Japanese style Udon noodles along with Japanese curry and maybe it is a matter of taste but both the dishes had excess soya sauce making them salty and bitter. I was later told that the noodles should be paired with Yamakazi whiskey and the curry with Jasmine rice to counter the soya sauce taste. It sounded like a good advice but a little late for this time. For dessert, brownie with ice cream was ordered and it was easily the best item. Overall pricing is decent for the quality and ambience.

The moment we entered the place along with it's festive and classy decor and the maddening smell from the kitchen where cakes were being baked we were instantly transported to a different place. They mostly have ready cakes, cookies and cupcakes that can be bought at the counter and there is a good menu to order and take away later. The price at the beginning might look a little but wait till you have tasted either the cookies or the cakes. We were at loss of proper adjectives and were totally delighted. The brownie was perfectly baked with taste of butter and the other ingredients adding to the flavor. This was one of the best brownies I have had in a long time.

They had a blueberry cheesecake in dessert and said that's all they can offer. We'll ordered the cake and had her cut it. None of them bothered to wish her or atleast be by our side while she was cutting the cake. Why do I bring this up?

First of all, the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen. I was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances. I politely asked to replace the drink that was served. But things got too much for me when I found a hair in the crispy corn. When I put this into light to the serving staff, they just tried to take away the plate and all I got to listen was they will replace it. That\u2019s what drove me mad.

Also apparently the good quality of ingredients that go into brewing of the beers ensure they do not contribute to the dreadful beer belly !\n\nWe tasted almost all of their beers thanks to their sampler set containing Belgian Kreik, Chamborlette, La Trappe Witte, Dubbel, Erdinger Weisbier, Erdinger Dunkel and Schuimzuiper.

I used to love Chennai 10D And with that brand I went to Hyd 10D. Firstly they took cover charge for a couple and they had no seats. Could have told us we have no seats we would not have paid cover charge. We stood for good 20 mins and then given bad seats near the speaker where one couldn't even talk! And then the waiters weren't serving us food properly. Had to ask them twice after whicj they took order and when they did they didn't give us cutlery. Can you even imagine??? I had to ask that give forks !!!!!!! I had the worst experience ever of going to a place. Extremely disappointed. Please learn how to manage a crowd. Also I wanted to book my table beforehand. But the option was not even available on Zomato and they won't pick up call. It just felt they didn't want things to be systematic.

A group of 20 people from work visited this place, we didn't have great expectations, at the same time we didn't foresee a terrible experience that it eventually would turn out to be. Half of us were seated close to the glass facing the Gachibowli road, thanks to their incredible maintenance, the ac was so poor, we were all sweating profusely. We weren't served starters for atleast 40 minutes. The choice of plates and their maintenance is extremely poor to say the least. The food (starters, main course, desserts) tasted so bad that most of us were content just eating curd and ice cream. We will never be going back to this place.\nRating: 1\nMetadata: 25 Reviews , 7 Followers\nTime: 9/13/2018 1:16\nPictures: 0\n7514:"}}
