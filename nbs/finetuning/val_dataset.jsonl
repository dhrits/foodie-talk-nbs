They also have a bar setup and dance floor as well.\n\nFood- 3/5\n\nWe were about 15 people opted for buffet. The broccoli and spinach soup was very tasty and had right amount of spiciness. For starters we had crispy veg- perfect, chilli paneer- very spicy, hara bhara kebab - was decent.\nFor main course, the veg spread was not very interesting and was not appetising.\nDESSERTS were the best!
