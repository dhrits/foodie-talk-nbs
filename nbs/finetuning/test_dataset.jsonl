Perfect taste and great delivery.\n\nI chose the North Indian Thali with the paneer option, they also served dal and raita. The rotis were soft and rice was good as well.\n\nAn ideal place to eat North Indian food with a very little pocket burn! \ud83d\ude42\nRating: 4\nMetadata: 86 Reviews , 216 Followers\nTime: 10/23/2018 23:15\nPictures: 1\n7514:", "a910c4e5-3347-464a-8ffc-ecbeb1579313": "Restaurant: Marsala Food Company\nReviewer: Naman Goyal\nReview: It such a worst experience will never come back again.

Just a 5 mins walk and you could find the big Shah Ghouse complex housing the restaurant, pan shop, tea shop and this Shawarma joint. \n\nLot of crowd and filled with online orders. Delivery boys lining up to take a parcel of shawarmas. Amidst all this rush, I ordered for a Special Rumali Chicken Shawarma for RS 120. Got it in a jiffy and I haven't had much shawarmas before.\n \nThis was absolutely delicious and filled with Chicken and more chicken along with all of the mayonnaise, sauces etc. I guess I checked out the reviews here beforehand and I told them to make it less spicy.

ZOMATO shows order is in the kitchen. But no call, no delivery even by 10.15 pm. The branch number on Zomato was incorrect. Called up Dominos hotline and they said they'll reach out to the branch and they'll call back. Waited for 15 min. No call back. Called the hotline again and the guy puts me on hold while he reaches out to the branch. 5 min later i am disconnected. Called up again and the same message that they will reach out to the branch is thrown on my face. Finally had it enough and asked them to cancel my order and refund the money.\n\nI anyway don't eat Dominos pizza given some pretty bad prior experience. But ordered on my wife's insistence.
